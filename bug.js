This bug occurs when using the Expo `Camera` component with a custom `onBarCodeScanned` function.  The barcode scanning works correctly, but the `onBarCodeScanned` function is called multiple times for a single barcode, leading to unexpected behavior and potentially multiple API calls with the same data. This behavior is inconsistent and doesn't appear to be related to any specific barcode type or environment.
